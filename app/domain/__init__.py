Domain Layer - Core business logic and entities.

This layer contains:
- Domain entities (pure Python classes representing business concepts)
- Value objects (immutable objects defined by their attributes)
- Domain services (business logic that doesn't belong to a single entity)
- Interfaces/protocols for external dependencies

The domain layer has NO external dependencies and represents
the core scientific logic of ExoHabitabilityLab.
