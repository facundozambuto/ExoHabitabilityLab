# ExoHabitabilityLab Scoring Configuration
# 
# This file configures the weights and parameters for the habitability scoring engine.
# Modify weights to adjust the relative importance of each factor.
# 
# Weight Guidelines:
# - 1.0 = standard importance
# - >1.0 = increased importance
# - <1.0 = reduced importance
# - 0.0 = factor disabled (not recommended)

# Factor Weights
# Higher weights give more influence to a factor in the final score
weights:
  # Stellar Factors (star properties)
  stellar_type: 1.0           # Spectral class (O, B, A, F, G, K, M)
  stellar_luminosity: 0.7     # Light output and radiation levels
  stellar_age: 0.6            # Age affects stability and time for life
  habitable_zone_position: 1.5  # Critical: is planet in the HZ?
  
  # Planetary Factors (planet physical properties)
  planet_radius: 1.2          # Size determines composition
  planet_mass: 1.0            # Mass affects atmosphere retention
  planet_density: 0.8         # Density reveals composition
  equilibrium_temperature: 1.3  # Surface temperature is crucial
  surface_gravity: 0.9        # Affects atmosphere and biology
  
  # Orbital Factors (orbit characteristics)
  orbital_eccentricity: 0.8   # Climate stability
  tidal_locking: 0.6          # Day/night effects (lower weight - uncertain)
  
  # Derived Factors (inferred from multiple properties)
  atmosphere_retention: 1.1   # Can the planet hold an atmosphere?
  magnetic_field: 0.7         # Protection from stellar wind (lower - hard to measure)

# Score Normalization Method
# Options:
# - weighted_average: Sum of (score × weight) / sum of weights (default)
# - geometric_mean: Product of score^weight, rooted by sum of weights
# - minimum: Conservative approach using the lowest factor score
normalization_method: weighted_average

# Confidence Weighting
# When true, factors with lower confidence contribute less to final score
weight_by_confidence: true

# Confidence Multipliers (when weight_by_confidence is true)
confidence_weights:
  very_high: 1.0
  high: 0.95
  medium: 0.8
  low: 0.5
  very_low: 0.2

# Score Categories
# Define the boundaries for habitability categories
score_categories:
  very_high:
    min: 0.8

    description: "Good habitability potential - favorable conditions exist"
  moderate:
    min: 0.4
    description: "Moderate habitability potential - some favorable conditions"
  low:
    min: 0.2
    description: "Low habitability potential - significant challenges exist"

# Missing Data Handling
# How to handle missing input parameters
missing_data:
  default_score: 0.0          # Score when data is missing
  default_confidence: very_low  # Confidence level for missing data
  exclude_from_calculation: false  # If true, missing factors don't affect score

# Advanced Settings
advanced:
  # Minimum number of factors required for a valid assessment
  min_factors_required: 3
  
  # Enable logarithmic scaling for extreme values
  log_scale_extremes: false
  
  # Penalize assessments with many missing parameters
  incompleteness_penalty: 0.0  # 0.0 = no penalty, 0.5 = 50% penalty at 0% data
